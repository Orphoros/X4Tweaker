# Security Policy

X4 Tweaker is currently in development and not yet ready for use outside of the development environment.

## Security

The security of software products, which includes all source code repositories managed through GitHub, is a top priority and all efforts are made to ensure that the codebase is secure. X4 Tweaker does not modify the game's files in any way. It only generates XML files.

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any repository owned by Orphoros, please report it as described below.

## Reporting Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them by emailing to `contact at orphoros dot com`.

## Supported Versions

Currently, due to the early stage of development, there are no releases available. Therefore, the only supported version is the latest commit in the `main` branch.

## Preferred Languages

Keep all communication in English.
